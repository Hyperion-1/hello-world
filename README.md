# hello-world
Obligatory tutorial repository


A wise man once said that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. While this simple branch/main is trivial, it is good to get the foundations of version control. I learned in school how much being able to 'cntrl-z' a project can matter. 

Also because the tutorial said so: 

Primary interest and language of choice is java, what I was tought in school and what I know. Also through school I have experience with css, html, javascript, mySql, and C++. Further I have some experience with Linux and drivers through my time with the robotics team, something that I would like to get back into later on down the road.
